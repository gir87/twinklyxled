# twinklyxled
A python script that checks the content of an online txt file by polling each 5 seconds to set a preset for Twinkly lights via xled and xled_plus
For example, if the txt contains 'water' it will set to preset 'Water' after 5 seconds, if it contains 'fire' it will set to preset 'Fire' etc.
Very simple!
